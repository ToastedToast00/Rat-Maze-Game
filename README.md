# Rat-Maze-Game
A remake of a game I made in Scratch in 2020 and finished for school in 2023.
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/615103018/

This game is a 3D environment played as a 2D game with a top down perspective in which you bring a rat through a maze.
The rat will be controlled via tank controls (turning and move forward/backward, no strafing).
