# Rat-Maze-Game
### Looking for a proper game name, suggestions welcomed
A remake of a game I made in Scratch in 2020 and finished for school in 2023. <br>
[You can view the game here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/615103018/) in which you control a rat through a maze to the end of each level. <br>

<br>
The image depicts the first level made in the iteration of the game that was made public for a school project. <br>
The starting point is not marked but on the left side of the picture, with the end goal being the lighter colored green shape.
## Primary Goals
The aim of this repository and game is to make the game linked above in Godot as not just a remake but also expansion.<br>
Hopefully you can expect a handful of features coming to the game which are to be listed below: <br>
- [ ] Fully functional and customizable control scheme
- [ ] A 2D Game made in a 3D scene
- [ ] A remake of all the old levels
- [ ] Creation of newer levels
- [ ] Potential for a level editor
- [ ] Multiple Difficulties to choose from
- [ ] Skins locked behind difficulty
- [ ] Level Editor Uploading and accessible to all.
