# Rat-Maze-Game

### Looking for a proper game name, suggestions welcomed
A remake of a game I made in Scratch in 2020 and finished for school in 2023. <br>

The image depicts the first level made in the iteration of the game that was made public for a school project.

## Primary Goals
The aim of this repository and game is to make the game linked above in Godot as not just a remake but also expansion.<br>
Hopefully you can expect a handful of features coming to the game which are to be listed below: <br>
- [ ] Fully functional and customizable control scheme
- [ ] A 2D Game made in a 3D scene
- [ ] A remake of all the old levels
- [ ] Creation of newer levels
- [ ] Potential for a level editor
- [ ] Multiple Difficulties to choose from
- [ ] Skins locked behind difficulty
- [ ] Level Editor Uploading and accessible to all.

## How to navigate branches and versions
Main branch will be the most recent branch that is going to be uploaded via GitHub Desktop, and have it's name updated to reflect a version, 
given how early this is being implemented I will be titling the main branch to be 0.01 after I figure out my current issues with the recent branch pull request, 
with an attempt at a weekly update including a small bit of a devlog in the discussions tab for anyone to suggest ideas.
